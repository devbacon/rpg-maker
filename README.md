Create RPG maps and set up games that can host multiplayer scenarios.


#### Initial Notes:
* Provide grid guide on main page
* Allow users to click on vertices and edges of the gird
* Provide ways to update map state with UI by clicking nodes and using tools
* Create editing tools such as line, shape, tile fill, and remove
* Represent map object data such as vertices, edges, and tile information in back end
* Represent vertices as XY coordinates
* Represent edges as groupings of vertices
* Structure data in such a way that 3D implementation will be possible
* Allow for tile data editing such as image fill and height
